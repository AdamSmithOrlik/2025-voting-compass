Border Security 
    - The Conservatives have pledged to add at least 2,000 border agents, extend Canada Border Services Agency powers along the entire border and install border surveillance towers, as well as truck-mounted drone systems to spot unauthorized crossings. They would install high-powered scanners at all major land crossings and shipping ports.

Climate Change, Energy
    - Conservatives would repeal all carbon pricing, including on industrial emitters. They would boost incentives (e.g., expand tax credits) for businesses that reduce emissions and to promote clean energy technologies. The party hasn't announced its carbon emissions reduction target. It would support an east-west pipeline and would approve projects such as LNG Quebec. The party would be open to exporting oil from the Port of Churchill and has pledged to speed up development of the port.

Cost of Living
    - The Conservatives say they would drop the tax rate on the lowest income tax bracket from 15 per cent to 12.75 per cent. They would defer capital gains taxes if the proceeds are reinvested in Canada. They would increase the annual TFSA contribution limit by $5,000 a year, provided the money is invested in Canadian companies. The party would remove the GST on new homes sold for under $1.3 million and on Canadian-made vehicles. It promises to allow working seniors with an annual income under $42,000 to earn as much as $34,000 without paying taxes, and let seniors continue to contribute to RRSPs until age 73, rather than the current limit of 71. The party would also allow travelling trades workers to write off the full cost of food, transportation and accommodations. Conservatives have pledged to streamline support for veterans by automatically approving disability applications not processed within 16 weeks and improving access to education and training benefits.

Crime, Justice
    - The Conservatives would use the notwithstanding clause, which gives legislatures in Canada the power to override portions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to introduce consecutive sentences for offenders convicted of multiple murders. They would put in place a “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” law to make criminals convicted of three offences ineligible for bail, probation, parole and house arrest and give them a minimum sentence of 10 years. They would also designate those criminals as dangerous offenders to prevent their release until they prove they are no longer a danger. It would impose mandatory life sentences on anyone involved in the trafficking, production and distribution of over 40 mg of fentanyl. A Conservative government would create a new offence, “assault of an intimate partner,” to "deliver tougher sentences for anyone who abuses an intimate partner.” It would require strict bail conditions for anyone accused of intimate partner violence, such as mandating the use of GPS ankle bracelet monitoring, “with any breach of conditions resulting in immediate imprisonment.” It would ensure that the killing of “an intimate partner, one’s own child or a partner’s child” would be treated as first-degree murder. If elected, the Conservatives would redirect Canada Revenue Agency resources toward targeting offshore tax havens and create a “name-and-shame” publication to expose corporations evading taxes. The party plans to expand the offshore tax informant program and give whistleblowers up to 20 per cent of the recovered funds when they report illegal tax schemes. Conservatives would pass a Stop Scamming Seniors Act to hold banks and telecom companies accountable for catching scams, introducing a $5-million fine for companies if they do not use the latest technology to stop scams and mandatory jail time and fines to “financially cripple” fraudsters.

Defence 
    - The Conservatives would reinforce the military and commit to the NATO spending target for member nations (two per cent of gross domestic product). They say “extra revenue from expanded trade with the U.S.” would go to the Armed Forces. They say they would double the size of the 1st Patrol Group of the Canadian Rangers from 2,000 to 4,000 rangers. They would acquire two additional polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy and deliver the two polar icebreakers currently being built for the Coast Guard by 2029. They would build at least one permanent Arctic military base within two years.

Foreign Policy
    - The Conservatives would slash foreign aid and divert the money to Canada's military. They would support Ukraine by selling Canadian oil from proposed pipeline projects like Energy East, which TransCanada cancelled in 2017. They want Ukraine to be part of all peace negotiations related to the war. The party is against having Russia join the G7.

Government Spending 
    - Conservatives would cut government support for businesses and foreign aid. They plan to defund the CBC but maintain Radio-Canada. They would cut the federal public service and have called for public servants to be given clear assignments and be monitored to ensure they're completing tasks. The Conservatives don’t plan “big changes” to the equalization program.

Guns
    - A Conservative-led government would reverse the Liberals’ gun-buyback program. It would add at least 2,000 border agents, extend powers of the Canada Border Services Agency along the entire border and install surveillance towers, as well as truck-mounted drone systems to spot unauthorized crossings and prevent gun trafficking. To intercept car thefts as well as gun and drug trafficking, the Conservatives would install high-powered scanners at all major land crossings and shipping ports. 

Health Care 
    - Conservatives would abolish supervised consumption sites and promote recovery and rehab. They would be open to imposing mandatory drug treatment on minors and prisoners “when they are found to be incapable of making decisions for themselves." The party said that under a Conservative government, Canadians who have access to existing federal dental care, child care and pharma care programs would not lose those services.

Housing 
    - The Conservatives would cut the GST on new homes up to $1.3 million. They say the GST measure will cost between $3.96 billion and $4.97 billion. They would tie federal funding to cities to the number of housing starts. Cities or municipalities would be expected to increase the number of homes they build by 15 per cent each year; they would offer bonuses to municipalities that surpass that target. For every dollar of development taxes cut, a Conservative-led government would match that amount to a maximum of $25,000 per home, for a total possible savings of $50,000. It would sell off 15 per cent of federally owned buildings so the land can be used to build affordable homes. It would implement a NIMBY (not in my backyard) fine on municipalities that block construction because of "egregious" opposition from local residents. 

Immigration
    - They promise to reduce the number of non-permanent residents in Quebec and would grant the province more powers to choose temporary immigrants. They would tie Canada's population growth rate to a level that's below the number of new homes built, and would also consider factors such as access to health care and jobs. They would cap the number of asylum seekers Canada receives. They promise to crack down on fraud linked to international students and temporary workers. 

Indigineous
    - The party wants to repeal C-69, the federal government’s Impact Assessment Act, which requires respecting the rights of Indigenous people when assessing resource projects. It would approve federal permits for mining in northern Ontario's Ring of Fire.  Conservatives would incentivize First Nations to support resource development projects through industry taxes. It would support an optional First Nations Resource Charge, which allows First Nations to directly collect tax revenues based on the use of their ancestral lands. Proposed by the First Nations Tax Commission, the model is designed to simplify negotiations between resource companies and First Nations. It wouldn't preclude communities from following existing impact benefit agreements. The party supports the implementation of Jordan’s Principle to support First Nations children. It would put back on the table a $47.8 billion First Nations child welfare reform deal.

Infrastructure 
    - The Conservatives would create an office to handle all regulatory approvals across all levels of government. Only one application and one environmental review would be required for each potential resource project. The party would limit wait times for approvals to one year. They would commit $1 billion over three years to the construction of a road connecting First Nations communities and the critical mineral deposits in the Ring of Fire to the Ontario highway network, while allowing companies investing in the Ring of Fire to pay a share of their federal corporate taxes to local First Nations. They would designate areas as "shovel-ready" zones to accelerate the construction of a liquefied natural gas project in Quebec. They would repeal the federal government's Impact Assessment Act (C-69), which allows federal regulators to consider the potential environmental and social impacts of various resource and infrastructure projects. They want to create a national energy corridor that would make it easier to fast-track approvals for large-scale infrastructure projects. The party would be open to exporting oil from the Port of Churchill. 

Jobs 
    - The Conservatives would reinstate apprenticeship grants of up to $4,000. They would fund training halls to help develop 350,000 workers over five years by expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program. They say smaller unions would also have equal access to funding that covers up to 75 per cent of the costs of building and running those programs. The party would allow union training centres and colleges to pre-register apprentices for EI, with the aim of creating a “special class of rapid EI payout for skilled tradespeople.” The Conservatives say they would work with provinces to “harmonize health and safety regulations” so tradespeople can work anywhere in Canada without having to repeat training. The party would also allow travelling tradespeople to write off the full cost of food, transportation and accommodation. They promise to allow working seniors with an annual income under $42,000 to earn as much as $34,000 without paying taxes, and to let seniors continue to contribute to RRSPs until the age of 73, rather than the current limit of 71. To support fish harvesters, Conservatives would improve monitoring of Canada’s fishery stocks, enforce DFO regulations around fishing, and ensure that new entrants purchase access quota and fishing rights at fair market value from existing licence holders who are willing to sell.

Taxes 
    - The Conservatives say they would drop the tax rate on the lowest income tax bracket from 15 per cent to 12.75 per cent. They would defer capital gains taxes if the proceeds are reinvested in Canada. They would increase the annual TFSA contribution limit by $5,000 a year, provided the money is invested in Canadian companies. The party would remove the GST on new homes sold for under $1.3 million and on Canadian-made vehicles. They promise to allow working seniors with an annual income of under $42,000 to earn as much as $34,000 without paying taxes, and let seniors continue to contribute to RRSPs until age 73, rather than the current limit of 71. The party would also allow travelling trades workers to write off the full cost of food, transportation and accommodation. If elected, the Conservatives would redirect Canada Revenue Agency resources toward targeting offshore tax havens and create a “name-and-shame” publication to expose corporations evading taxes. The party plans to expand the offshore tax informant program and give whistleblowers up to 20 per cent of the recovered funds when they report illegal tax schemes.

US Relations, Tarrifs 
    - The party would continue to impose counter-tariffs until the U.S. removes all of its tariffs. A Conservative government would direct most of the revenue collected from counter-tariffs toward tax relief, with a sum set aside for targeted relief for workers. The party would cut GST from the sale of new Canadian-made cars as long as Trump’s tariffs are in place. Conservatives have pledged to create a "Keep Canadians Working Fund," a temporary loan and credit program that would provide up to $3 billion in short-term credit lines and low-interest loans for affected businesses
