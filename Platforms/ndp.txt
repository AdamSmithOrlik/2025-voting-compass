Border Security 
    - The NDP committed to rehiring “every border officer cut by the last Conservative government” to curb the number of illegal guns entering Canada. 

Climate Change, Energy
    - The NDP supported the removal of consumer carbon pricing. The party would keep the industrial carbon price. It would introduce a border carbon adjustment mechanism to tax imports from countries that don’t have comparable carbon pricing. The NDP says it would cut “$18 billion in oil and gas subsidies,” but did not specify which. It is against building an LNG pipeline in Quebec and believes the province should have the right to veto energy projects on its territory. The party opposes the Energy East project but isn't shutting the door to pipelines. It would prioritize creating an east-west electricity grid. It would continue the 100 per cent tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles. It would rebate Canadian families and businesses $10,000 for buying or leasing over 12 months a Canadian-manufactured zero-emissions vehicle and $5,000 for buying or leasing a zero-emissions vehicle manufactured elsewhere.

Cost of Living
    - New Democrats pledge to raise the amount of untaxed income from $16,129 to $19,500. The party would eliminate GST on essentials (e.g., energy, internet and mobile phone bills). They would keep the proposed increase in the capital gains tax, reinvesting that revenue in universal pharmacare, improving access to health care, national rent control, new housing and a cap on grocery prices. The party would double the amount of the Canada disability benefit and increase the guaranteed income supplement at a combined cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. It wants to open up more $10-a-day child-care spots. It would increase the EI replacement rate to two-thirds of insurable earnings, with a minimum weekly benefit of $450; extend EI benefits to 50 weeks nationwide; implement a national 360-hour standard to qualify for benefits; and remove the one-week waiting period. It would expand pharmacare, dental care and mental health supports for Canadians and ban U.S.-style private health-care clinics.

Crime, Justice
    - The New Democrats would end tax agreements with known offshore tax havens like Bermuda and require corporations to provide a “genuine business reason” for using offshore accounts, in order to prevent tax evasion. If elected, an NDP government would implement public country-by-country financial reporting to prevent multinational corporations from hiding profits.

Defence 
    - New Democrats would increase defence spending to two per cent of Canada’s GDP by 2032. They would cancel the contracts for U.S.-built F-35 fighter jets and P-8 Poseidon aircraft. They would establish new marine search and rescue stations — including in central Nunavut — and build new small craft harbours. They would attempt to re-establish a full-time military base in Inuvik, N.W.T., set up a base in Iqaluit as well as a new CAF Reserve Unit in Whitehorse. They would aim to complete construction of a deep-water port in Nanisivik, Nunavut. They would also work with Indigenous communities and the territorial government to establish more deep-water ports, including in Qikiqtarjuaq and Grays Bay.

Foreign Policy
    - New Democrats would aim to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid and invest in the foreign service. They would create a 500-member Quick Reaction Force, which would be ready to deploy in UN peacekeeping missions. They would ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The NDP says it would recognize a Palestinian state.

Government Spending 
    - To increase government revenue, the party would eliminate bearer shares that hide stock ownership and boost compliance funding to Canada Revenue Agency's enforcement section dealing with international and corporate taxation. The party says it would strive toward balancing the budget — aiming to have a falling debt-GDP ratio within four years — but would be willing to borrow “when required” to support Canadian families. The party is promising a “path” to balance the budget once the U.S. trade war is resolved.

Guns
    - An NDP-led government would hire back at least 1,100 border officers to stop the illegal flow of firearms into Canada. 

Health Care 
    - The NDP would strengthen public universal health care by expanding pharmacare, dental care and mental health support for Canadians. The party plans on delivering full public pharmacare within four years, starting with 100 of the most prescribed medications, such as pain medication, antibiotics and antipsychotics at estimated cost of $3.5 billion. It would ban U.S. companies from buying Canadian health-care businesses. It would enforce the Canada Health Act to end privatization of health care and require provinces seeking federal funding to uphold public health-care standards. The party has pledged to hire 35,000 new nurses by 2030 and would streamline the path for U.S. and internationally educated nurses. The NDP would make health-care transfers from the federal government to the provinces conditional on their nurse-to-patient ratios and their compensation offers. The party also promises to cover mental health services for those not covered by private insurance plans.

Housing 
    - The NDP would put in place a $16-billion strategy to support building affordable homes. They would replace the housing accelerator fund with permanent funding for two new programs: the Canadian homes transfer and the communities first fund. The party is aiming to build three million affordable homes in the next five years. They would redesign and double the Public Land Acquisition Fund, investing $1 billion over five years to build more rent-controlled homes. They would set aside all suitable federal Crown land in order to build more than 100,000 rent-controlled homes by 2035. They would speed up approvals on lands owned by the federal government to build homes sooner. They also say they would require the CMHC to offer low-interest, public-backed mortgages. The New Democrats are promising more money for the Rental Protection Fund — a federal program that supports community housing projects. They say they would ban corporate landlords from buying existing affordable rental properties and stop providing them with low-interest federal loans and mortgage loan insurance if they gouge tenants. They would “rescue at-risk home-building projects impacted by tariffs,” with the aim of stabilizing housing markets and creating jobs in construction.

Immigration
    - The party has not set an immigration target but has said levels should match Canada's needs and take into account whether there are enough resources to welcome newcomers. They would end Canada's closed work permits and provide temporary workers with open work permits to help them avoid abusive employers.

Indigineous
    - New Democrats would support the Nunavut Housing Corporation plan to build 3,000 housing units. They would pave the Cambridge Bay runway in Nunavut to help make air travel more affordable and reliable. They would work with local partners and the territorial government of Nunavut on the Kivalliq Hydro-Fibre Link, a terrestrial and telecommunications link, to improve energy security and northern sovereignty. The party would aim to complete construction of a deep-water port in Nanisivik, Nunavut. It would attempt to re-establish a full-time military base in Inuvik, N.W.T., set up a base in Iqaluit as well as a new CAF Reserve Unit in Whitehorse. It would also work with Indigenous communities and the territorial government to establish more deep-water ports, including in Qikiqtarjuaq and Grays Bay. The party would fully adopt the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and implement recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The party supports the implementation of Jordan’s Principle to support First Nations children. It wants the federal government to co-develop a process with the National Children’s Chiefs Commission for future negotiations on First Nations child welfare.

Infrastructure 
    - New Democrats would undertake a major construction program and require only Canadian steel to be used in all federally funded infrastructure projects. They would prioritize creating an east-west electricity grid. They are against building an LNG pipeline in Quebec and believe the province should have the right to veto energy projects on its territory. The party opposes the Energy East project but isn't shutting the door to pipelines. They would favour Canadian companies in the bid selection process, as well as suppliers and contractors with a unionized workforce. 

Jobs 
    - New Democrats would expand Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) “super-priority” protections for workers to include post-employment benefits, (e.g., unpaid wages, severance). It would raise the cap on the Wage Earner Protection Program (WEPP) to cover the wages people are owed. WEPP is currently capped at $8,844. They pledge to strengthen and enforce directors’ liability for unpaid compensation and create a mechanism for workers to be made whole through trust-held funds or federal guarantees. The NDP wants to stop “predatory foreign takeovers” by applying “net benefit” to economic and employment criteria, in particular, unionized jobs to prevent foreign companies from buying Canadian assets with the intention of dismantling them and firing workers. It would increase transparency about promises companies may have made in their takeover bid and it would include unions in the review. 

Taxes 
    - New Democrats pledge to raise the amount of untaxed income from $16,129 to $19,500. The party would eliminate GST on essentials (e.g., energy, internet and mobile phone bills). They would keep the proposed increase in the capital gains tax, reinvesting that revenue in universal pharmacare, improving access to health care, national rent control, new housing and a cap on grocery prices. The NDP is promising to raise $94.5 billion in revenue by implementing a one per cent tax on households with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million, two per cent for those worth $50 million to $100 million and three per cent for those over $100 million.

US Relations, Tarrifs 
    - New Democrats are in favour of retaliatory tariffs. They would put “every dollar” collected from retaliatory tariffs toward supporting impacted workers in industries such as auto manufacturing, steel and aluminum. If U.S. President Donald Trump applied a tariff to all Canadian goods, New Democrats would impose a 100 per cent tariff on all Tesla products. To strengthen the economy during the trade war, an NDP government would issue five- and 10-year “Victory bonds” that Canadians could buy through a payroll deduction. Those bonds would pay an interest rate that is 0.25 per cent higher than an average five-year bank-issued guaranteed investment certificate (GIC). It would bar Trump from the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., in June, due to his undermining Canadian sovereignty. The party would ban U.S. companies from all federal government procurement contracts and projects when Canadian workers are available. It says it would stop U.S.-based corporations from “stripping valuable assets from Canadian plants” after receiving government bailouts. It would exempt Canadian-made cars and trucks from the GST.
