        In the interest of transparency I will describe exactly how the compass operates, and for those interested the full code with be availble publically at <Github Link Here>. 

        ## Topic Selection 
        - The compass is based on a set of 7 topics with subtopics that are relevant to the Canadian political landscape:
            1. Economic Policy
                - Fiscal Policy
                - Taxation
                - Minmum Wage
                - Spending 
                - Labour Policy
            2. Social Policy
                - Healthcare
                - Education
                - Curriculum Control
                - Housing
                - Immigration
                - Indigenous Rights
                - LGBTQ+ Rights
                - Homleessness and Drug Addiction
                - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
            3. Foreign Policy
                - Military Spending
                - Foreign Aid
                - Trade Policy
                - Israel/Palestine
                - Ukraine/Russia
                - Refugees and Border Control
            4. Environment
                - Emissions
                - Carbon Tax
                - Fossil Feuls 
                - Green Investment
            5. Justice and Civil Liberty
                - Crinimal Justice 
                - Civil Liberties 
                - Free Speech 
                - Police Reform
            6. Science and Technology
                - Research Funding
                - AI Regulation
                - Internet Access
                - Privacy and Data Protection
            7. Governance 
                - Electoral Reform
                - Government Transparency
                - Federalism 

        ## User Input
        The compass asks the use to rate their position on each of the abovementioned subtopics on a scale from -1 to 1 representing the extreme positions (as articualted below) and where 0 is the status quo.

        The use will also be asked to rate the subtopic from 0 to 1 representing the importance of that subtopic to their overall political position. E.g. a single issue voter is free to set one subtopic to 1 and the rest to 0. 

        ## Party Positions
        In an effort to be as unbiased as possible I have used AI to estimate the current party positions from online sources. Further, I have used 3 different AI models--ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity--and aggreagated the results to get a more accurate picture of the party positions.

        ## Distance Metrics 
        I elect to use two different metrics the measure the distance between the users responses and the party positions. 1) Weighted Euclidean distance and 2) weighted Cosine Similarity. For more detial please see my blog post <link here>. 

        - The weighted Euclidean distance returns a result ranging from 0 (perflectly overlapping values) to 1 (maximally distant values).
        - The weighted Cosine Similarity returns a result ranging from -1 (anti-aligned) to 1 (perfectly aligned).

        # Comparison
        The compass will compute the weighted distances for each subtopic separately and then a total distance across all topics. These numbers will tell the user how closely aligned they are with each party.

        The compass will also display a number of plots calculated from the data, but these need to be interpreted carefully; the visual results do not always retain the weightings, and where relevant a cautionary note will be made.
